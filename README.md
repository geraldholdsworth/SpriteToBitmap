# Sprite Converter
Windows, Linux and macOS application to read in RISC OS sprite files to either view them or convert them to Windows bitmap or Portable Network Graphics format (PNG).<br>
<br>
This has now left beta stage, although it is still very much in development, and has moved up from version 0 to version 1. There are still bugs to iron out, features to add, and sprite formats to support.<br>
