* Convert from BMP or PNG to Sprite, and export images as sprite file.
* Deal with sprite type 8 (24bpp),9 (JPEG),17 (4:2:0 YCbCr) and 18 (4:2:2 YCbCr).
* Deal with mode types 'KYMC' and 'YCbCr - ITU-R'.
* Deal with 2 and 24 bpp masks.
* Add the monochrome palettes.
* Application hangs when trying to save images to files which are already open in another application.
* There remains an issue with 32bpp bitmaps. When the alpha channel is set to $FF, everything but the mask is made transparent. However, for some reason, this does not effect Alpha sprites which work perfectly.
